      <h1>The History of Smart Homes</h1>
	     <p>Smart homes started, as most things do, with ideas. Smart homes appeared in science fiction mostly in caution, but today the application of it is largely considered a convince. The foundation of smart homes started back in the early 1900s with the use of appliances like the first engine-powered vacuum, though we wouldn't classify that as a 'smart' appliance. In 1966-1967 appliances like the ECHO IV and the Kitchen Computer were developed but never hit the markets. 1991 marked a new age in research into Gerontechnology, combining gerontolgy and technology in an effort to make the lives of senior citizens easier. True smart homes didn't gain popularity until the late 1990s and early 2000s. Today our smart homes are often oriented towards security and saving energy.</p>
